_Please Note: This project is designed exclusively for Tendermint._

**Story Line**:

Aliens have invaded earth - and are here to destroy everything.
The ancient Greek civilization is on the brink of extension. 

The journey to death and destruction begins when an invader ship runs out of Liquid Hydrogen. (Fuel that powers spaceship.) The spaceship makes an emergency landing on Earth and now the invaders (Aliens) have to fight for their survial. Either they live or they are killed by Greeks.

The invaders are distributed accross 12 ancient cities of Greek. For their survival, they have to stay isolated in the city. If any other Alien comes in that city - they fight. The curse is such; if two or more Aliens come together in same city, it is burned to the ground. Also, the path taking them to the adjacent city is burned to - trapping them in that city.

On each ring of the bell, (iteration in programming) Aliens migrate to adjacent city in any direction (North, South, East or West) unless they are trapped. If the curse in inflicted; the Alien looses his life and the city & its roads are burned.

Only the fierce survivor lives long to see the world. The dance of death does not stop until either of the following happens:
 <br /> _1. There are no more Aliens left in Greek._
 <br />_2. Aliens have migrated 10,000 times._
  
PS:

**Dioikitís is the Chancellor of Aliens giving them command from International Space Station.
Syssoreftís is the Knight of dead. He keeps Dioikitís informed - who is dead and who is alive.**
